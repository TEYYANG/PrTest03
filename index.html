        Hi My name is Sunthia Agdeppa Ragusante But you can call me Teyyang I'm 19 years old born on 
        May 14 2004, in Mariano Marcos Memorial Hospital, i live in Brgy#25 Callaguip paoay Ilocos Norte.
        Place that i want to explore is Paris since I graduate in grade 6, I have 3 siblings and
        i'm only Daughter among my siblings, My hobby is cooking And my favorite Sport is Basketball.

        I'm Addicted reading Wattpad, i never like to spend my hours out of doors. I'am for a confined 
        life with my study. Reading is my favorite, this has ever acted as a joy of my day to day life.
        I get immense pleasure from this it may be a rainy day, it is not possible to go out. But i'am
        quite happy with my book. But i'am in the crowded world od the stories of mighty authors.
        They never fail to give me comfort and delight.

        I'm studying at Mariano Marcos State University College of Industrial Technology, 2nd year college
        Major in BSInTech-CT 

        My goal as a student is to excel academically, be actively involved in Extracurricular activities
        gain valuable experiences through internships, and give back to the community through volunteering.
        I believe achieving these goals will help me become a well rounded individual and prepare me for a
        successful future.
